# Morph-Attack-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
 I built a Morph Attack Detection system that identifies forged facial identities in videos. Using VGG16 for feature extraction, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and SVM for classification, the model detects morphs with frame-wise voting. A Tkinter GUI enables real-time video upload, detection, and annotated playback.
